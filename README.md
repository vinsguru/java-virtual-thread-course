Learn how to make your Java applications run smoother, faster, and more scalable using modern concurrency techniques. This course covers everything from the fundamentals of threads to advanced structured concurrency using Virtual Threads, all with hands-on projects to cement your learning.

## Course Highlights:

- **Understanding Concurrency**: Start with the basics. Understand **platform threads**, their lifecycle, and the challenges of traditional concurrency. Learn why scaling with conventional threads is difficult and how **Java Virtual Threads** provide a lightweight, high-performance alternative for handling thousands of concurrent tasks efficiently.

- **Executor Service Mastery**: Dive into **ExecutorService** and see how it works with both platform threads and virtual threads. Learn to manage concurrency, execute tasks in parallel, and optimize thread usage for scalable applications.

- **Completable Future**: Explore **CompletableFuture** for asynchronous task execution with Virtual Threads. Learn practical patterns for chaining tasks, handling exceptions, and managing timeouts in a clean, declarative way.

- **ThreadLocal and Scoped Values**: Understand **ThreadLocal** for storing thread-specific context and the challenges it poses. Then explore **Scoped Values**, the modern alternative that works seamlessly with both platform and virtual threads, avoids memory leaks, and simplifies context propagation.

- **Preview of Structured Concurrency**: Get a hands-on introduction to Java’s **Structured Concurrency APIs** (preview), learning how to manage groups of tasks as a single unit, improve reliability, and simplify lifecycle management of concurrent tasks.

- **Hands-On Application Development**: Apply your knowledge in a **Spring Boot Web project** using Virtual Threads. Learn how these concurrency concepts integrate into real-world application development.

- **Performance Testing with JMeter**: Test the scalability of your application using **JMeter**, measuring throughput and response times to ensure optimal efficiency under various workloads.

- **Migration Made Easy**: Conclude the course with a practical migration guide to transition your existing applications to Java Virtual Threads effortlessly. Get ready for a future where your programs effortlessly combine concurrency and scalability.

Unlock the full potential of **Java Virtual Threads, Scoped Values, and Structured Concurrency**. Elevate your programming skills and learn to design scalable, efficient, and modern Java applications!

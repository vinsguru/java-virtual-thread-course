Master modern, high-performance Java concurrency and build applications that scale effortlessly. This course takes you from foundational **Multithreading** concepts to the cutting edge of **Virtual Threads**, **Structured Concurrency**, and **Scoped Values**, all reinforced with hands-on Spring Boot projects.

## Course Highlights:

- **Understanding Concurrency**: Start with the basics. Understand **platform threads**, their lifecycle, and the challenges of traditional concurrency. Learn why scaling with conventional threads is difficult and how **Java Virtual Threads** provide a lightweight, high-performance alternative for handling thousands of concurrent tasks efficiently.

- **Executor Service Mastery**: Dive into **ExecutorService** and see how it works with both platform threads and virtual threads. Learn to manage concurrency, execute tasks in parallel, and optimize thread usage for scalable applications.

- **CompletableFuture Integration**: Explore **CompletableFuture** for asynchronous task execution with Virtual Threads. Learn practical patterns for chaining tasks, handling exceptions, and managing timeouts in a clean, declarative way.

- **ThreadLocal and Scoped Values**: Understand **ThreadLocal** for storing thread-specific context and the challenges it poses. Then explore **Scoped Values**, the modern alternative that works seamlessly with both platform and virtual threads, avoids memory leaks, and simplifies context propagation.

- **Structured Concurrency**: Get a hands-on introduction to Java’s **Structured Concurrency APIs** (preview), learning how to manage groups of tasks as a single unit, improve reliability, and simplify lifecycle management of concurrent tasks.

- **Hands-On Application Development**: Apply your knowledge in a **Spring Boot Web project** using Virtual Threads. Learn how these concurrency concepts integrate into real-world application development.

- **Performance Testing with JMeter**: Test the scalability of your application using **JMeter**, measuring throughput and response times to ensure optimal efficiency under various workloads.

- **Migration Made Easy**: Conclude the course with a practical migration guide to transition your existing applications to Java Virtual Threads effortlessly. Get ready for a future where your programs effortlessly combine concurrency and scalability.

Don't just learn concurrency. Master the future of high-performance Java. Unlock the full potential of **Virtual Threads**, **Structured Concurrency**, and **Scoped Values** to design the most scalable, efficient, and modern applications on the platform.
